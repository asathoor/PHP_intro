Sample code.


## Microlite '81

Games and programming are related. 
The "open source" role playing game Microlite '81 is used as inspiration here. 

Is a demonstration of "HTML Kickstart" combined with PHP. 
User input and random dice throws form a character sheet. 
The cookie can save the information as long as it exists. When the user returns, 
PHP will get the roleplaying character again. The solution is not persistent, 
since the data are stored in the client browser via a cookie.
